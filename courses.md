## Machine Learning (taught by Andrew NG)

Course Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Certification URL: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/5HRG4QX6GAVG

Topics include: 
* Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
* Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Machine Learning Specialization
